## Bloxbiz SDK (Unofficial)

This is an unofficial SDK for the Bloxbiz API. It is not affiliated with Bloxbiz in any way.

This SDK is a 1:1 conversion of the original SDK. However, it's modified to work in a Rojo workflow instead of a rbxm file.

## Installation

### Wally
Add the following to your `wally.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
bloxbiz-sdk = "pnlmon/bloxbiz-sdk"
```
